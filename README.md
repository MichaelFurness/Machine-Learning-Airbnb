# Airbnb-Capstone

Overview
Since its launch in 2008 Airbnb has transformed from an aspiring start to a world wide global phonomono, with the company now worth and estimated Â£27bn. Since then Airbnb has grown to over 81,000 cities across the globe with over 6 million listed properties, where on average two million people rest their heads in an Airbnb property each night. Airbnb is no longer just for the visiting tourists, this growth and success as meant that more and more people are moving away from tranditional long-term tenacies to flexiable and more profitable short-term lets.

Of the back of this change organisation have now formed that will look after people's listings managing everything from uploading the property, cleaning and managing guest. As the market becomes more competstive what is the right price? What features pushes up the price? Is the property priced to high? All these questions must be answered for companies and landlords to be competative and successful in this changing landscape.

Using data from Inside Airbnb, a publicly sourced Airbnb database, I will hope to answer these questsions and highlight the main factors that effect the listing price.
